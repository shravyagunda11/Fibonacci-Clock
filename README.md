# Fibonacci-Clock

This project implements a Fibonacci Clock using HTML and JavaScript, inspired by Philippe Chr√©tien. The clock uses five squares with values from the Fibonacci series (1, 1, 2, 3, 5), summing to 12, which corresponds to the 12 hours on a clock.

How it works:

Red squares: Represent hours.
Green squares: Represent minutes.
Blue squares: Represent both hours and minutes.
White squares: Null values
